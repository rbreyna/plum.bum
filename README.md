## What is plum.bum?

**plum.bum** is an app for reluctant writers. Writing is as rewarding as it is difficult, and it's often easier to say, "Well, I'll just write tomorrow" when the words aren't coming and there's no real impetus to be productive--and no feedback that you are, in fact, productive when you do get some words on the page.

That's where **plum.bum** comes in.

**plum.bum** gamifies the process, allowing the user real-time feedback and proof of concept about their productivity. **plum.bum** allows the user to set a goal and a completion date. Our app gives the user information about how many words they've written each day, their best writing day, and how many days they've written in a row.

## How do I use plum.bum?

Simple. Sign up, log in, and start writing.
